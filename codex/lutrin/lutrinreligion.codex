    "There are some that don't believe our theologists, but our religion seems to be our best understanding of the past.

    NOTE TO THE PLAYER: This is really long-winded, so the character is just putting a TL;DR of what is said to have happened in the following pages of this codex entry.
    Yes, it really is just that long that the TL;DR is multiple pages. Religious texts tend to be on the long side.",
    "Aeons ago, The Creator kickstarted the universe's creation. First to be created were the stars, the pinpricks of light in the darkness of the night sky. Next were the planets and moons, in their vast multitude of varieties. While They were able to create and manipulate matter of many varieties in unlimited amounts, They were neither omnipresent nor omniscient, and needed to create a vessel to carry Themself around so that They could see their creations.",
    "But this soon became boring for Them, and They decided to have a little fun by going onto one of the planets and forming small figures in Their own image made of starstuff. Much to Their delight, the figures became animate, and things remained stable for millenniae, with the new race of celestial beings making vast strides in technology thanks to Their assistance.",
    "However, things soon became unstable for the celestials, with their kind becoming divided and even plotting to destroy their creator, and the Creator was forced to extinguish Their creation, even though They did not want to. Thusly, They spared a few individuals of one of the factions that were loyal to Them from this punishment, instead taking them on as researchers. Learning from Their mistake, They created a being of lesser power to Themself.",
    "But this new deity was full of hubris, even though they were guided by the Creator as they created a new race in their own image, the lesser deity treated the new beings like servants, and amassed an army of them in an attempt to overthrow the Creator, and They were forced to end that experiment by killing the lesser deity. The now-leaderless race still believed that their leader-god was alive, and continued their worship, their faith slowly changing over the aeons, the race's cult leaders using science and rituals to fool the cult followers.",
    "Starting to get a little bothered by their failures, the Creator decided to look to natural processes after looking at an ocean world and seeing how a race of amphibious bipeds, the Hylotl, had emerged from the swamps and rivers and started to form a civilization of their own while the Cultivator was busy with Their experimentation in sentients. Now a little inspired, They created our race, the Lutrin, by taking a small group of semiaquatic mammalian carnivores from the same planet and re-shaped them into a form similar to what we",
    "look like today, then just sat back and watched the fireworks unfold when They introduced Their creation back into its original habitat. Things were a little rocky at first, and the Creator vowed to not repeat the oopsie of having two species of sentients occupy the same planet. Their past mistake of interfering in the affairs of Their creations having taught Them to not do it, They decided to just let this little debacle continue. Unbeknownst to Them, a small band of both Lutrin and Hylotl managed to stow away on Their vehicle, and subsequently hid in",
    "the Creator's main facility. Seeing how the two civilizations managed to coexist, the Creator tried Their luck with creating other races in other star systems.",
    "However, Their creations weren't the only sentients popping up. Several times, They went to a world, only to encounter a sentient race that had already created a civilization there. However, They discovered a common theme in how there was never a race of plant-men, aside from a single, solitary time on a heavily-forested jungle planet. They made an educated guess that this was probably thanks to some kind of feature of plant life.",
    "It was at around this time that the Creator discovered the band of stowaways that had snuck into their lab. They were pretty ticked-off, and it was only thanks to the Celestials that had been chosen making defensive claims for the Lutrin and Hylotl that They did not destroy the new group of sentients that They'd found in Their lab. The Creator even took the newcomers on as additional research assistants, giving them access to Their equipment, so skilled were the Celestials at arguing for the saving of the stowaways.",
    "This led to the creation of a race of mushroom-men, which was quickly moved out of the Creator's home in its entirety when the Hylotl lab assistants started to get ill thanks to some of the more mature individuals of the new beings starting to come of age. After the mushrooms had been gotten rid of, the only trace of the mushroom-men ever having existed being the presence of their settlements and some spores floating around on said planets, those in the labs created a log warning themselves to never do that thing again due to",
    "someone having already tried, with it ending disastrously.

    Things quickly took a turn for the worse when a comet fell from the skies into a mountain of fire on the Hylotl and Lutrin homeworld, wiping out all but a few small pockets of sentient beings. The Hylotl and Lutrin populations were nearly wiped out thanks to ash suffocating them when it rained from the skies and mixed into the waterways, leaving just the deep-sea Hylotl civilizations and the land-based Lutrin settlements when",
    "the upper levels of the oceans grew clouded with debris and volcanic ash, and more destructive from the rotting organic material that floated in it.

    This cataclysm was met by a request from a few of the Hylotl and Lutrin in the Creator's care to return home in order to repair and repopulate their world. The Creator, being keenly interested in nurturing and preserving life, agreed to the request, but on one condition: those that left the Creator's lab would never return. The Lutrins and Hylotl agreed to these",
    "terms, and they were soon sent on their way.

    However, the Creator didn't pack enough food for the journey, thanks to one of the Lutrin females being a mother-to-be that wasn't showing yet. Her increased appetite caused them to run out of consumable items midway through the journey. This incident led the survivors of this voyage to discover that their predatory ancestry gave them a liking for the taste of their amphibious crewmates, with the mother being first among the",
    "otters to find out as much during a severe hunger pang. Their subsequent dietary shift caused them to be able to survive through the remainder of the journey, although there were no Hylotl that remained alive on board when they returned.

    They arrived back on their home world to a planet that had completely lost the surface-dwelling civilizations and had only tribes of nomads above-water, forcing the group to rebuild their civilization from the ground up. They were successful, and",
    "hunting Hylotl that were outside of the safety of the underwater settlements soon became an ingrained part of the new Lutrin culture. This was thanks to the famine that was everywhere but in the Hylotl cities, due to both the volcanic winter that had recently happened and the Hylotl having discovered technology and techniques allowing them to farm indoors at sustainable levels.",
    "A few centuries later, the Ruin came into this universe, a being that was a world and made of jealousy and tentacles that sought to undo the Creator's work. The battles between the two of them were intense, with many planets being destroyed as a result of their clashes. In the end, the Creator triumphed, but at great cost to Themself. Severely weakened from an extended tussle with the Ruin, the Creator knew that They had no real chance against it. They were too big to get where They needed to in order to truly finish off their enemy, so They",
    "had to destroy Themself in order to create a star-eater right next to the Ruin, sealing it away. This task completed, They sent six of the seven largest pieces of Themself away to six different races of sentients using some of what little of Their strength that remained, keeping Their very largest part near the seal to ensure that the Ruin didn't get out from its prison. The remaining millions upon millions of fragments were scattered to the far corners of the universe, eventually lodging in nebulae and slowly accumulating gas until they",
    "created a new race of star-people.

    As for the Lutrin and Hylotl that remained behind in the Creator's home back when the comet fell, nobody has heard from them, though many attempts have been made to try to find our long-lost brothers and sisters."
