Based on what it says and the signature at the bottom, the incident where the wrong uniform was in my locker must be Kenichi's handiwork, that meanie. He's why I'm glad there were fire extinguishers in the building that one time...",

He got really lucky that I used this ship and survived the escape of Earth, otherwise I would've lost the uniform forever."
