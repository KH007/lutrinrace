Mod by K_H (AKA Doctroid)

Special thanks to:
FutaraDragon: Helped with the hitboxes and miscellaneous stuff.
Sheights: Created the race that I modified the sprites of for an easier time making the species.
PVTSkittlez: Created the Race Template mod used to get a head-start on the coding.
Zancuno: Assisted with the body-sprite colorations and included a test world in their Lucario mod. Go check it out on the Steam workshop or on the Chucklefish modding forum!
